                                allow them to be more independent. I was a lead programmer on our team of 5, and this project is the result of nearly a year of work (from August 2021
                                to May 2022). We made use of Amazon Web Services and Node.js to create the app. I highly recommend checking out our system manual up above. It includes
                                all of our code, as well as screenshots of a near-final product. We ultimately received an A on this project, as well as all of its supplementary
                                material.

                                has several functionalities, such as the ability to interpret and carry-out user commands, the ability to schedule and load processes, the ability to
                                perform its own memory management, the ability to use interrupt driven I/O, and some others. We completed this assignment for our Operating Systems
                                class, and were one of the only groups to successfully implement the interrupts into our system.

                                add users, create new groups and manage their members, create new files, read/write/execute those files, manage read/write/execute permissions
                                on each file for specific users, groups, or everyone, etc. It was written entirely in Python, and includes many files which are described on
                                the Github page.

                                to write this program in Python, and it uses a Vigenere cipher and Rijndael's Galois field multiplication as part of the encryption process.

                                <strong>About:</strong> This was a computer forensics assignment I had as my final project in my computer incident response course. This was an individual
                                assignment where we were each given a Windows 7 virtual machine, and our task was to get access to the machine (by exploiting a vulnerability in Windows 7)
                                and to document any evidence of a fake driver's license operation in a formal forensic report. Additionally, the computer had several instances of "kitty
                                porn", which were pictures of cats meant to represent illegal material. During the investigation, upon finding such material, we were required to receive a
                                warrant from our teacher and write a separate report on the illegal material (also linked above). These 2 reports detail all material found on the system
                                and organizes the findings in chronological order to create an attack narrative. I highly recommend taking a look at least at the main report above if you
                                have the time.

                                In addition to my forensic reports, I have included a copy of my portfolio for this incident response course. The most significant portion of this portfolio
                                is a list of security tools we used during the class. This portfolio also include documentation of my National Cyber League placement of 180th worldwide.

                                cybersecurity club. This competition focuses on computer forensics and penetration testing, and is hosted online over the span of 2 weekends. The first
                                weekend is the individual competition, where everyone must work on their own. In this competiton, I placed in the top 98% (180/6478). The second weekend
                                of the competition is the team game, where you can work with 1 to 6 more people. My team scored in the top 99% (69/3910) in the team game. This competition
                                was a ton of fun and I learned so much about cybersecurity during those weekends. Feel free to check out either of my score reports above!

                                <strong>About:</strong> This was my final project for my penetration testing course (CYBE 467). I was on a team of 6 people, and our goal was to perform
                                a full penetration test on a network of computers which were set up at West Virginia University. This network was made up of multiple subnetworks, each
                                containing multiple computers. The penetration test involved scanning systems with Nmap, password cracking with John the Ripper and Hashcat, connecting
                                to machines using Secure Shell and Remote Desktop Protocol, examining vulnerable web applications, searching file systems, looking through MySQL databases,
                                and more. The machines were a mix of Linux and Windows machines, and the test was conducted using a Kali Linux virtual machine. I strongly encourage you
                                to take a look at our final report (linked above) for screenshots and more details on what we found.

                                of vulnerable software and run a testing software (I used SonarQube) on it. I chose to run my testing software on the Morgantown Local Restaurants website I made
                                in another class (that project can also be found on this site). I ended up finding a SQL injection error using the software, and I fixed the error by using a
                                prepared statement in the PHP code. The full documentation of this assignment can be found in this report.

                                in a C program to gain a root shell on a Linux virtual machine. The was accomplished by using GNU Debugger to manipulate specific locations in memory and
                                insert a shellcode (written in Assembly). As can be seen in the lab report, I was able to get a root shell, although it was not easy given how specific the
                                shellcode needed to be.

                                from an old UNIX tutorial website. The website is intended to give West Virginia University students an overview of using the Linux command line. The project was
                                helpful to me because it allowed me to refine my Linux CLI skills, and at the time I was still relatively new to using Linux. I went with a more simplistic style
                                for the website so as not to distract too much from the actual content.

                                The purpose of the website was to allow students and other people who are new to Morgantown, WV find local restaurants to eat at. The website includes
                                about 30 restaurants, each stored in a JSON file which can be easily updated. The site was created primarily using PHP and HTML but there was some
                                JavaScript used in it as well. Users could create and access individual accounts via a SQL database with PHPMyAdmin. They could use these accounts to
                                write reviews of any restaurants on the website. The website was created on a team of 5 people.

                                <strong>About:</strong> This is a Hangman game I made on a team of 4 in MS-DOS using x86 Assembly Language. It uses simplified but stylish ASCII art,
                                and has an efficient algorithm for checking letters in the game using AND/OR logic. While this program could have been implemented much more easily
                                using another programming language, the challenge of using assembly ended up being very educational. I strongly encourage you to check out our report
                                linked above, or you may instead prefer to watch a video of my group's final presentation. For reference, I am the second speaker in our presentation.

                                <strong>About:</strong> This was the final project for my first computer engineering lab. The assignment was to program a functioning CPU using VHDL in the
                                Quartus II development software. Unfortunately this project does not include any hardware components, mostly because this was completed in the semester when
                                schools first closed down for the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, my partner and I were able to get our project working correctly after spending a long time
                                debugging. I would recommend taking a look at our final report if you are interested, which includes snippets of code we each wrote.

                                I also included my portfolio for that particular computer engineering lab. This portfolio includes my lab reports for every single lab I had that semester.
                                If you would like an overview of some of my computer engineering work, this contains a lot of it.

                                <strong>About:</strong> These are two programming assignments I completed in one of my programming languages courses. The 2 programs use Flex and Bison
                                respectively. The Flex program takes an input text (in the correct format) and outputs an analysis of the words contained in that text. The Bison program
                                generates a simple COBOL-based grammar for arithmetic. Both programs were written in C. Check out the README.md files of each Github for more detailed
                                information.

                                <strong>About:</strong> This is actually a collection of projects from one of my programming languages classes. They each have a similar theme of performing
                                the same functions using different programming languages. The goal of these projects was to demonstrate the differences between different types of programming
                                languages. I found these projects particularly interesting because it gave me an opportunity to use programming languages I do not use very often, such as
                                Rust and Haskell.

                                <strong>About:</strong> This was the first large programming project I worked on in my college career. The project was a semester-long project to
                                recreate an SQL database using Java. This included implementing SELECT, INSERT INTO, DELETE, UPDATE, DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE,
                                transactions, etc. Because I took the Honors version of this course, I had a total of 12 "modules" as part of this project, while non-Honors students
                                only had 8. This project introduced me to several different programming concepts, including regular expressions, strong vs. weak references, etc. The
                                database was created using a hash table. Note that the Github repository linked here is not the original repository, as that was managed by my
                                professor and I no longer have access to it.

                                <strong>About:</strong> This was one of my first projects as an engineering student when I started college. In this project, my group of 4 people was
                                assigned a location somewhere in the world, and our goal was to develop a sustainable (renewable) energy system which could power a small town in that
                                location at an efficient cost. Our group specifically chose to focus on wind and solar power in our research, as they made the most sense in our
                                given location. This project involved substantial research in renewable energy, and in the weather data of our given location. It is not especially
                                relevant to computer programming, but it was one of the first professional engineering reports I helped to write, and it helped me to learn about the
                                engineering design process.
