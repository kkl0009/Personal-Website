                            <strong>About:</strong> This is a cross-platform mobile application which was designed to help elderly individuals keep track of their food items to
                            allow them to be more independent. I was a lead programmer on our team of 5, and this project is the result of nearly a year of work (from August 2021
                            to May 2022). We made use of Amazon Web Services and Node.js to create the app. I highly recommend checking out our system manual up above. It includes
                            all of our code, as well as screenshots of a near-final product. We ultimately received an A on this project, as well as all of its supplementary
                            material.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This is a command line-based operating system I programmed over the course of a semester with 3 other group members. The OS
                            has several functionalities, such as the ability to interpret and carry-out user commands, the ability to schedule and load processes, the ability to
                            perform its own memory management, the ability to use interrupt driven I/O, and some others. We completed this assignment for our Operating Systems
                            class, and were one of the only groups to successfully implement the interrupts into our system.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This was a computer forensics assignment I had as my final project in my computer incident response course. This was an individual
                            assignment where we were each given a Windows 7 virtual machine, and our task was to get access to the machine (by exploiting a vulnerability in Windows 7)
                            and to document any evidence of a fake driver's license operation in a formal forensic report. Additionally, the computer had several instances of "kitty
                            porn", which were pictures of cats meant to represent illegal material. During the investigation, upon finding such material, we were required to receive a
                            warrant from our teacher and write a separate report on the illegal material (also linked above). These 2 reports detail all material found on the system
                            and organizes the findings in chronological order to create an attack narrative. I highly recommend taking a look at least at the main report above if you
                            have the time.

                            In addition to my forensic reports, I have included a copy of my portfolio for this incident response course. The most significant portion of this portfolio
                            is a list of security tools we used during the class. This portfolio also include documentation of my National Cyber League placement of 180th worldwide.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This is a Hangman game I made on a team of 4 in MS-DOS using x86 Assembly Language. It uses simplified but stylish ASCII art,
                            and has an efficient algorithm for checking letters in the game using AND/OR logic. While this program could have been implemented much more easily
                            using another programming language, the challenge of using assembly ended up being very educational. I strongly encourage you to check out our report
                            linked above, or you may instead prefer to watch a video of my group's final presentation. For reference, I am the second speaker in our presentation.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This was my final project for my penetration testing course (CYBE 467). I was on a team of 6 people, and our goal was to perform
                            a full penetration test on a network of computers which were set up at West Virginia University. This network was made up of multiple subnetworks, each
                            containing multiple computers. The penetration test involved scanning systems with Nmap, password cracking with John the Ripper and Hashcat, connecting
                            to machines using Secure Shell and Remote Desktop Protocol, examining vulnerable web applications, searching file systems, looking through MySQL databases,
                            and more. The machines were a mix of Linux and Windows machines, and the test was conducted using a Kali Linux virtual machine. I strongly encourage you
                            to take a look at our final report (linked above) for screenshots and more details on what we found.

                            of vulnerable software and run a testing software (I used SonarQube) on it. I chose to run my testing software on the Morgantown Local Restaurants website I made
                            in another class (that project can also be found on this site). I ended up finding a SQL injection error using the software, and I fixed the error by using a
                            prepared statement in the PHP code. The full documentation of this assignment can be found in this report.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This was a lab report I completed in one of my cybersecrity courses. The object of the lab was to use a buffer overflow vulnerability
                            in a C program to gain a root shell on a Linux virtual machine. The was accomplished by using GNU Debugger to manipulate specific locations in memory and
                            insert a shellcode (written in Assembly). As can be seen in the lab report, I was able to get a root shell, although it was not easy given how specific the
                            shellcode needed to be.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This was one of my first experiences with web development. It is a website which was hosted on Amazon Web Services Lightsail.
                            The purpose of the website was to allow students and other people who are new to Morgantown, WV find local restaurants to eat at. The website includes
                            about 30 restaurants, each stored in a JSON file which can be easily updated. The site was created primarily using PHP and HTML but there was some
                            JavaScript used in it as well. Users could create and access individual accounts via a SQL database with PHPMyAdmin. They could use these accounts to
                            write reviews of any restaurants on the website. The website was created on a team of 5 people.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This is actually a collection of projects from one of my programming languages classes. They each have a similar theme of performing
                            the same functions using different programming languages. The goal of these projects was to demonstrate the differences between different types of programming
                            languages. I found these projects particularly interesting because it gave me an opportunity to use programming languages I do not use very often, such as
                            Rust and Haskell.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This was the final project for my first computer engineering lab. The assignment was to program a functioning CPU using VHDL in the
                            Quartus II development software. Unfortunately this project does not include any hardware components, mostly because this was completed in the semester when
                            schools first closed down for the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, my partner and I were able to get our project working correctly after spending a long time
                            debugging. I would recommend taking a look at our final report if you are interested, which includes snippets of code we each wrote.

                            I also included my portfolio for that particular computer engineering lab. This portfolio includes my lab reports for every single lab I had that semester.
                            If you would like an overview of some of my computer engineering work, this contains a lot of it.

                            <strong>About:</strong> This was one of my first projects as an engineering student when I started college. In this project, my group of 4 people was
                            assigned a location somewhere in the world, and our goal was to develop a sustainable (renewable) energy system which could power a small town in that
                            location at an efficient cost. Our group specifically chose to focus on wind and solar power in our research, as they made the most sense in our
                            given location. This project involved substantial research in renewable energy, and in the weather data of our given location. It is not especially
                            relevant to computer programming, but it was one of the first professional engineering reports I helped to write, and it helped me to learn about the
                            engineering design process.
