                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Kollin Labowski, and I am currently working towards my Ph.D. in Computer
                    Science at the University of Florida. My research is in applied cryptography and
                    hardware security. I graduated from West Virginia University in August of 2022 with my
                    B.S. in Computer Science with an area of emphasis in Cybersecurity and a minor in
                    Mathematics. I have over 8 years of programming experience in languages such as Java,
                    Python, C, and JavaScript, including a year spent working on an Agile team in a
                    professional software engineering environment. I'm a huge math fan, with a particular
                    interest in connecting theory with practice. In my free time, I enjoy playing board
                    games, going for hikes, challenging friends to games of badminton/racquetball/pickleball,
                    reading, and making music on my bass guitar. Thanks for visiting my website, and please
                    considering checking out the above links!
